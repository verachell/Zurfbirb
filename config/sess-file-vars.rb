# the items below added by installer script. Ignore this comment if you 
# used the installer script - everything is automatically handled including perms.
# These variables represent site-specific values for $zb_sess_filename , 
# $zb_sess_dirname and $zb_sess_crypt_key_file. 
#
# If not using the installer script, you can set your own names for these
# files and directories - keep them out of the document root though. 
# Also, the files need rw privileges for the www-data user.
# The installer script handles the perms but if you are not using 
# the script, you need to change those perms yourself for any locations outside
# of /tmp
#
# Regardless of installer script or not, you may choose to comment out, 
# delete or not define any or all of the items below, and in that case the 
# session handler will pick defaults that will work, but could be less secure,
# particularly in the case of the key
